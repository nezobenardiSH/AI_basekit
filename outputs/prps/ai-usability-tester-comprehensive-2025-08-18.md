├── personas/           # JSON-based persona management
├── core/               # Test orchestration
└── utils/              # Logging, error handling
```

#### Task Group 1.1: Project Infrastructure (0.5 days)

## Embedded Validation Framework

### Validation Agents Integration

This PRP includes comprehensive validation agents throughout implementation:

#### Phase-by-Phase Quality Assurance
**Agent**: `@phase-qa-tester`  
**Trigger**: **MANDATORY at the end of each Phase implementation** (before other validation agents)
**Target**: ≥80% confidence threshold for phase progression
**Execution Sequence**: 
- **Phase 1 End**: Execute 23 Phase 1 test cases → proceed to other validation agents only if ≥80% pass
- **Phase 2 End**: Execute 12 Phase 2 test cases → proceed to other validation agents only if ≥80% pass  
- **Phase 3 End**: Execute 9 Phase 3 test cases → proceed to other validation agents only if ≥80% pass

**Test Cases**: 47 comprehensive test cases covering:
- **23 Phase 1 tests**: Core navigation, persona system, AI integration, browser automation
- **12 Phase 2 tests**: Advanced interactions, behavioral metrics, report generation, UI functionality
- **9 Phase 3 tests**: Error recovery, performance benchmarking, documentation, production readiness
- **Cross-functional tests**: Integration, user acceptance, performance, security validation

**Critical Implementation Note**: The @phase-qa-tester agent MUST be the first validation agent executed at each phase completion. Other validation agents (@functional-test-agent, @integration-test-agent, @security-agent, @code-reviewer-agent) can only proceed after @phase-qa-tester achieves ≥80% confidence.

#### Functional Testing Validation
**Agent**: `@functional-test-agent`
**Trigger**: After each major component completion
**Target**: ≥80% confidence threshold
**Validation Scope**:
- AI navigation accuracy and persona behavior simulation
- Form handling, modal interaction, dynamic content management
- Report generation quality and actionable insight delivery
- User interface functionality for PM/designer workflows

#### Integration Testing Validation
**Agent**: `@integration-test-agent`
**Trigger**: After each phase completion + continuous during development
**Target**: ≥80% confidence threshold  
**Validation Scope**:
- Browser automation stability across different web environments
- AI API integration reliability with fallback mechanisms
- Cross-component integration and data flow validation
- Performance under concurrent load and resource constraints

#### Security Validation
**Agent**: `@security-agent`
**Trigger**: Before production deployment (Phase 3) + continuous review
**Target**: ≥80% confidence threshold
**Validation Scope**:
- Secure AI API credential handling and encryption
- Browser automation security without vulnerability exposure
- Persona data privacy and access control validation  
- Network security for internal tool usage and data transmission

#### Code Review Validation
**Agent**: `@code-reviewer-agent`
**Trigger**: Continuous throughout all phases (every major code change)
**Target**: ≥80% confidence threshold
**Validation Scope**:
- Code quality, maintainability, and comprehensive documentation
- Browser automation best practices and error handling robustness
- AI integration security and credential management
- Performance optimization and efficient resource utilization

### Validation Decision Logic

**Phase Progression Requirements**:
- **≥80% confidence from all applicable agents**: "Phase validated successfully. Continue to next phase?"
- **<80% confidence from any agent**: "Validation concerns detected. Address issues before proceeding."

**Continuous Quality Assurance**:
- Real-time validation feedback during development
- Automated test execution for regression prevention
- Manual validation checkpoints at each quality gate
- Escalation procedures for persistent validation failures

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Priority Technical Risks

**1. AI API Reliability and Performance**
- **Risk**: External AI service outages or performance degradation affecting core functionality
- **Probability**: Medium (25%) - External dependency risk
- **Impact**: High - Platform unusable without AI decision making
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Dual AI provider setup (OpenAI + Anthropic) with automatic failover
  - Decision caching system to reduce API dependency
  - Graceful degradation with manual fallback modes
  - SLA monitoring with proactive alerting

**2. Browser Automation Stability**  
- **Risk**: Chrome updates or website changes breaking automation scripts
- **Probability**: High (40%) - Ongoing web evolution risk
- **Impact**: Medium - Tests fail but platform remains functional
- **Mitigation**:
  - Playwright version pinning with controlled update cycles
  - Multiple element detection strategies (CSS selectors, XPath, visual recognition)
  - Automated compatibility testing pipeline
  - Comprehensive error recovery with alternative interaction methods

**3. Persona Quality Dependency**
- **Risk**: Poor persona definitions yielding unreliable or misleading test results
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) - User-generated content quality risk
- **Impact**: High - Undermines platform value and team confidence
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive persona validation tools and templates
  - Best practices documentation with examples (Ahmad Rahman template)
  - Quality scoring system for persona behavioral completeness
  - Regular persona review and refinement process

### Medium Priority Business Risks

**4. Team Adoption and Change Management**
- **Risk**: PM/designer teams not adopting tool in daily workflows due to complexity or workflow disruption
- **Probability**: Medium (25%) - Change management risk
- **Impact**: High - Platform success depends on regular usage
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive user training and onboarding program
  - Integration with existing design and product workflows
  - Clear value demonstration through pilot project results
  - Ongoing support and iteration based on user feedback

**5. Over-reliance on AI Insights**  
- **Risk**: Teams using AI usability insights as replacement for human user research instead of preliminary screening
- **Probability**: Medium (20%) - Mission creep risk
- **Impact**: Medium - Reduced product quality from insufficient user validation
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear positioning as "preliminary testing" in documentation and training
  - Built-in recommendations for when human user research is required
  - Confidence scoring and limitations clearly communicated in reports
  - Regular review of usage patterns to prevent over-reliance

### Low Priority Technical Risks

**6. Performance and Scalability Limitations**
- **Risk**: Platform unable to handle increasing team usage or complex test scenarios  
- **Probability**: Low (15%) - Managed through architecture design
- **Impact**: Medium - Reduced utility as team and usage grows
- **Mitigation**:
  - Scalable architecture design with horizontal scaling capabilities
  - Performance monitoring with proactive capacity planning
  - Resource optimization and caching strategies
  - Clear usage guidelines and concurrent execution limits
